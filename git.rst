Getting Started with Git
========================

There are a lot of pages on the web dedicated to Git, this page just shows a few
random bits of information which might or might not help you getting started.

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) and it's great!

That's about all I'm gonna say about it in general, if you want to read more
about it, have a look at the links at the end of this page.

Cloning a Repository
--------------------

To obtain the contents of a remote repository, you have to *clone* it.
For example, to clone the repository where this very page was created from, do::

    git clone https://github.com/mgeier/homepage.git

This will create a directory named like the repository (in this case
:file:`homepage/`). ::

    cd homepage

Checking the Status
-------------------

At any time, you can get the current status of your files with::

    git status

Here you will see if there are changes to any files of the repository and if
there are local files which are not yet part of the repository (see below for
how to add files).

Getting Recent Changes from the Server
--------------------------------------

If the repository on the server changed since you cloned it, you can get up to
date with::

    git pull

But be aware that if you made changes to your local files, this may lead to
conflicts. It's a good idea to always commit before pulling (see below how to
commit changes).

Initial Setup
-------------

Before you make your first commit, you should set up a few things (you have to
do this only once)::

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email you@example.com

You may also want to set your favorite editor::

    git config --global core.editor "gvim --nofork"

To enable colors in ``git log`` et al.::

    git config --global color.ui auto

And, if you want, you can set a few aliases for your convenience::

    git config --global alias.s "status --short"
    git config --global alias.c "checkout"

    git config --global alias.lol "log --oneline --graph --decorate"
    git config --global alias.lola "log --oneline --graph --decorate --all"

With these aliases, you can use ``git s`` to get a short status display (one
line per file) and you can use ``git c mybranch`` instead of the significantly
longer ``git checkout mybranch``.
I find myself using *checkout* very often, so ``git c`` saves a lot of typing.

If you type ``git lola``, you'll see a nice and colorful ASCII display of the
previous commits and their tree structure.

All these options are stored in :file:`~/.gitconfig` (or somewhere else
depending on your operating system).
You can also store settings on a per-project basis. Just drop the ``--global``
option and the settings will be stored for your current Git repository in
``.git/config``.

Command Line Prompt
-------------------

When working with branches, it is crucial to know the currently active branch.
To show the current branch in the command line prompt, put this at the end of
your :file:`~/.bashrc` (or wherever else you store settings for your shell)::

    # add git branch to prompt
    GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1
    PS1="${PS1%'\$ '}"'$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")'"\$ "

You'll also see an asterisk, e.g. ``(master *)``, if your working directory is
*dirty*, i.e. if you have local changes which are not yet committed.

Committing Changes
------------------

Any new files have to be added to Git control before you can do anything with
them::

    git add myfile.txt

Once you have done some changes, you can make a commit::

    git commit -a

Here, your favorite text editor will be opened and you can (and *should*!) enter
a commit message, describing the changes you have made. After you save the
file and close the editor, the commit will actually be created.

A commit message should have a short (no more than 50 characters) one-line
summary in the first line, then a blank line and then a more detailed
description. Have a look at this `note about commit messages
<https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html>`_.

Remember, a commit is a local operation in Git, so nothing was transferred to
the server yet.

.. todo:: add before commit, staging area, local commits

Pushing Your Changes to the Server
----------------------------------

After one or several commits, you can push everything to the server::

    git push

If you created a new online repository and cloned the empty repository, you
have to use this command the first time to set up the ``master`` branch::

    git push origin master

After that, ``git push`` will suffice.

Creating and Switching Branches
-------------------------------

But you probably don't want to do that yet. You're probably not quite sure yet
if your changes are OK and you would like to wait with pushing them to the
``master`` branch. Probably you would like your colleagues to have a look at
your changes first.

That's where *branches* come into the picture.

To see what branches you already have, type::

    git branch

You'll probably get something like this::

    * master

This means you have only one branch which is called ``master``. This is
typically the default branch and most repositories have it but it is just a
branch as any other branch.
The asterisk marks the currently active branch.
You should also see this in your prompt if you did what I suggested in `Command
Line Prompt`_.

You can switch between branches with ``git checkout``. But you don't have
another branch to switch to ... so let's create one::

    git checkout -b fix-typo

The option ``-b`` combines creating a branch with directly switching to the
newly created branch.

Your local files didn't actually change by switching to the new branch because
for now, the branches ``fix-typo`` and ``master`` are just two different names
for the same thing.
But if you now start committing changes, these commits will end up in the
``fix-typo`` branch while the ``master`` branch will remain unchanged.

Let's check our branch-related situation::

    git branch

Which produces something like this::

    * fix-typo
      master

Now you can actually change something and then commit your changes::

    git commit -a

.. todo:: more about branches?

Merging Branches
----------------

.. todo:: more information about merging and potential merge conflicts

.. todo:: ``git mergetool`` is really useful!

Setting up Vim_ + fugitive_ as ``mergetool``::

    git config --global mergetool.fugitive.cmd 'gvim -f -c "Gdiff" "$MERGED"'
    git config --global merge.tool fugitive

On *macOS*, you can use *FileMerge* (you need to have *Xcode* installed)::

    git config --global merge.tool opendiff

.. _Vim: https://www.vim.org/
.. _fugitive: https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/

.. todo:: more advertisement for Vim and fugitive!

More Aliases
------------

Once you've worked some time with Git, you will realize that there are a few
commands that you use very often.  It's easy to create aliases that make you
type less.

I, for example, often use ``git rebase`` and afterwards I want to ensure that a
*fast forward* merge is done (instead of a separate *merge commit*).
Therefore, I have to type ``git merge mybranch --ff-only``, which is quite long
and tedious to type.  With the following alias, I can reduce this to
``git ff mybranch``::

    git config --global alias.ff "merge --ff-only"

Sometimes, after a ``git fetch`` or ``git remote update``, I want to
fast-forward my local branch to its newly fetched remote branch.
With my previous alias, I could do ``git ff origin/mybranch``.  This is still
too long, and Git should be able to automatically figure out which is the
correct remote branch.  With the following alias, the command is reduced to
``git ffu``::

    git config --global alias.ffu "merge --ff-only @{upstream}"

I seldom use ``git pull``, because if there are new commits on both upstream and
locally, a *merge commit* will be created automatically. And I don't like that.
To avoid a merge commit and to only actually merge if a merge commit can be
avoided (i.e. if a *fast forward* merge is possible), we can again use the
option ``--ff-only``.  With the following alias, I only have to type
``git pff``::

    git config --global alias.pff "pull --ff-only --prune"

The additional ``--prune`` option is very handy because it removes the remote
branches which were deleted on the server (which is not done automatically).

Ignoring Local Files
--------------------

.. todo:: :file:`.gitignore`, global ignore file with ``core.excludesfile``,
   reference to https://github.com/github/gitignore

Attributes
----------

You can set per-file (or per-path) attributes if you create a file named
:file:`.gitattributes`, for example like this:

.. code-block:: none

    *.bib diff=bibtex
    *.cpp diff=cpp
    *.h diff=cpp
    *.htm diff=html
    *.html diff=html
    *.java diff=java
    *.php diff=php
    *.py diff=python
    *.rb diff=ruby
    *.tex diff=tex
    *.pbxproj binary

GUIs for Git
------------

There are many GUIs for Git to choose from; I personally like *gitg* (available
as Debian package with the same name) most but there are many more available
(see https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

Getting Help
------------

To get help just use::

    git help

You'll get something like this:

.. code-block:: none

    The most commonly used git commands are:
       add        Add file contents to the index
       bisect     Find by binary search the change that introduced a bug
       branch     List, create, or delete branches

       fetch      Download objects and refs from another repository
       grep       Print lines matching a pattern
       init       Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one
       log        Show commit logs
       merge      Join two or more development histories together
       mv         Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
       pull       Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
       push       Update remote refs along with associated objects
       rebase     Forward-port local commits to the updated upstream head
       reset      Reset current HEAD to the specified state
       rm         Remove files from the working tree and from the index
       show       Show various types of objects
       status     Show the working tree status
       tag        Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG
    
    See 'git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>' to read about a specific
    subcommand or concept.
