Make Tutorial
=============

.. note::

  This is, much like the internet itself, and democracy, work-in-progress.

...

.. todo:: |make| runs other programs in the right order, handles intermediate files and generates files only if it's necessary (i.e. if the sources have changed).

|make| Without Makefile
-----------------------

Whenever you encounter a directory with a file called |Makefile| in it, you know
you can run |make| to automatically compile/generate/do whatever is specified in
the |Makefile|.

But you don't even need such a file. You can also use |make| all by itself.
To show an example for that, let's create a file called :download:`hello.cpp`
with the following content:

.. literalinclude:: hello.cpp
   :language: c++

Now we can simply run ... ::

  make hello

... and it will magically be compiled (that is, if you have |make| and a C++
compiler installed).

.. note::

  You can ignore the details for now, but if you are curious, this is the exact
  command that will be called by |make|::

    g++     hello.cpp   -o hello

  That means the C++ compiler is compiling (and linking) the source file
  :download:`hello.cpp` to produce an executable file called :file:`hello`
  (which you can run with ``./hello`` by the way).

  The command is automatically generated by this *implicit rule*:
 
  .. literalinclude:: Makefile.implicit_cpp1

  This uses the following variable declarations:

  .. literalinclude:: Makefile.implicit_cpp2

  The variable ``CXX`` is automatically set to the default C++ compiler (in our
  case ``g++``). The other variables are by default undefined, but you can use
  them to specify any options you like.

  You can find out about all the rules and variables that |make| considers by
  running ``make --print-data-base``, but more about all that later.

A Simple Makefile
-----------------

The command ``make hello`` was pretty simple, wasn't it? But we can make it even
simpler, but for that we first have to create a |Makefile| to specify all the
necessary details.
The most important things to write in there, are so-called rules_. Those
consist of *targets*, *prerequisites* and a *recipe*, which can have several
lines.

.. _rules: http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Rule-Syntax

.. literalinclude:: Makefile.rule

A *target* starts at the beginning of a line and ends with a colon.
On the right side of the colon, there are zero, one or several *prerequisites*
(separated by spaces). *Prerequisites* are sometimes also called *dependencies*.
On the following line, after a leading tab character, there can be a *recipe*,
which will be used by |make| to update the *target*, if necessary. *Recipes* are
sometimes also called *commands*.

But more about that later ...

Let's create a file called :download:`Makefile <Makefile.minimal>` with the
following content:

.. literalinclude:: Makefile.minimal

That's it. Nothing more. Only one line. Only 6 characters.

This is a rule which contains only a *target*, i.e. the thing we want to get in
the end. In our example that's an executable named :file:`hello`. There are no
*prerequisites* and no *recipe*. When |make| is called without specifying a
target (like we did before with ``make hello``), |make| chooses the first
target it encounters in the |Makefile|, which is in our case -- what a
coincidence! -- ``hello``.
With our brand-new :download:`Makefile <Makefile.minimal>` in place, we can now
simply call::

  make

... and it will do the same thing as before.

.. todo::
   this can happen::

      make: `hello' is up to date.

From now on, we will make our |Makefile| more and more elaborate and add many
features, but the call to |make| will mostly stay that simple. That's the
beauty of it.

If you run |make|, it looks in the current directory for a file called
:file:`Makefile` or :file:`makefile`. That's nice, so we don't have to specify
explicitly which file should be used. If we *do* want to specify a different
file, however, we can do so with the ``-f`` option, e.g.::

  make -f MyOtherMakefile

Cleaning Up
-----------

.. todo:: ``make clean``

.. todo:: clean-target, no prerequisites, one recipe

.. todo:: $(RM) vs rm

Adding Options
--------------

So using the built-in *implicit rules* is nice and easy, but what if we want to
tweak some options?

Well, that's no problem.
Let's say we want to add some options for the compiler, e.g. let's enable some
warnings. It's always a good idea to enable compiler warnings!
We do this by simply adding a variable to our
:download:`Makefile <Makefile.cxxflags1>`:

.. literalinclude:: Makefile.cxxflags1

When we now run |make|, we see that the actual command becomes::

  g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic    hello.cpp   -o hello

So it worked, our command line option was put where it belongs.

There are a lot of pre-defined variables ...

.. todo:: CXX, CXXFLAGS, CC, CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LDLIBS, LDFLAGS, ...

Now we know how to add options to our |Makefile| permanently, but what if we
want to try an option just once?

No problem, we can specify the directly at the command line as environment
variables. For example, if we want to try if our program can also be compiled
with a different compiler, we can do this::

  CXX=clang++ make

...

::

  clang++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic    hello.cpp   -o hello

Let's try something else. Let's run the optimizer on our little program::

  CXXFLAGS=-O2 make

...

::

  g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic    hello.cpp   -o hello
  
But why? What happened to our ``-O2`` setting?

Unfortunately, it was overwritten in our |Makefile|.
If you want to allow specifying options in environment variables, you have to
take care not to overwrite these variables.
The easiest way to do this, is to use the ``+=`` operator in your
:download:`Makefile <Makefile.cxxflags2>`:

.. literalinclude:: Makefile.cxxflags2

...

::

  CXXFLAGS=-O2 make

Et voilá::

  g++ -O2 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic    hello.cpp   -o hello
